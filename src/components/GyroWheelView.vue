        <p>The source code for GyroWheel APP is publicly available at <a

            <h3><strong>How to Install Windows Drivers</strong></h3>
            <p>There are multiple ways to install necessary software that establishes connection with the Android App.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Using Exe files:</strong></p>
            <p>Although downloading unknown .exe files can be risky, I can assure you that these files are safe and
                thoroughly tested.<br>
                But It's never bad to be safe than sorry on the internet, so I fully understand if you don't want to use
                them. <br>
                If you prefer a more transparent method, you can follow the steps below to use the source code
                directly.<br>
                <br>
                This app relies on the VigemBus driver to emulate a controller, so you need to first install it.<br>
                <a href="https://vigembusdriver.com/download/">Download VigemBus Driver</a><br><br>
                After installing the driver, you should download the correct exe file for your system, either x64 or x86
                version.<br>
                <a href="https://github.com/serdarbsgn/gyrowheel/tree/exe-files/dist">Download Exe Files</a><br><br>
                Click on the one your system is compatible with, and use the button on the right to download it in the
                next window.<br><br>


                And now, you should be able to open the executable file to see different methods of connecting your
                Windows machine and Android device.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Using python and downloading the source code.</strong></p>

            <p>This method requires you to download python first, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Install
                    Python here</a><br><br>
                after this, you'll need to download the source code for the app,<br>
                <a href="https://github.com/serdarbsgn/gyrowheel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Here's the link for source
                    code in zip file.</a><br>
                <a href="https://github.com/serdarbsgn/gyrowheel/tree/main">Here's the link for source code in github,
                    if you prefer this way.</a><br><br>

                After installing Python, use the <code>install.bat</code> file to install the necessary libraries, the
                VigemBus driver, and its DLL files<br>

                And now, you should be able to open <code>run.bat</code> or <code>run-gui.bat</code> to see different
                methods of connecting your Windows machine and Android device.<br>

            <h3><strong>How to Connect using Network Mode</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Select the "USE NETWORK" option in both Windows and Android devices and enter the IP address displayed
                in Windows app, into the first text field on your phone.<br>
                (If Windows app displays 192.168.1.42:12345 for example, you should enter 192.168.1.42 to text field on
                your phone.)<br>
                After correctly entering the IP displayed on your PC, use GyroWheel Mode, Gamepad Mode or Keyboard&Mouse
                mode. <br>

            </p>

            <h3><strong>How to Connect using Bluetooth Mode</strong></h3>
            <p>The Windows application attempts to find and display your computer's Bluetooth MAC address
                for easy entry in the phone app. If it fails to detect or finds multiple addresses, <br>
                you may need to enter or select the correct address manually.<br>

                To use Bluetooth mode, ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted, Bluetooth is enabled and that you have
                a Bluetooth-enabled computer. <br>
                Enter your PCâ€™s MAC address (you can use the "SHOW BLUETOOTH COMPUTERS" button to get nearby MAC
                addresses). <br>
                Use the "CONNECT TO MAC ADDRESS" button to initiate the connection while the script is active on your
                computer.<br>

                Once connected, the GYROWHEEL MODE, GAMEPAD MODE and Keyboard&Mouse Mode buttons will light up for
                use.<br>
